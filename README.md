Changelog: 
1. Added from 28 LEDs to 32 LEDs. 
2. Reposition all LEDs from diagonal positions to horizontal positions.  
3. Moves the components more outwards nearby the edge cut to make room for the LEDs spacing.  
4. Reposition U3 to the right side of the layout. 
5. Reposition other components from diagonal positions to vertical and horizontal positions.  
6. Reduce the radius Front Courtyard for both mounting hole to 0.4mm radius.  
7. The copper filler for the LED connections are set to, Pad connections: Thermal reliefs, Thermal relief gap: 0.2mm, Thermal spoke width: 0.8mm. 
8. All resistor and capacitor have been changed from 0603 to 0402 except Rx1 from 0603 to 1206.
